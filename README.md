# Polyphonic Music GAN

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning models that can be used to generate new data that is similar to a training set. This repository contains a GAN that is trained to generate polyphonic music, that is, music that contains multiple simultaneous melodies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow 2.0+
- MIDI files for training

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/polyphonic-music-gan.git


3. Collect and prepare MIDI files for training. The GAN requires a dataset of MIDI files to train on. You can use any publicly available MIDI files or create your own. Once you have your dataset, preprocess the files by converting them to a format that the GAN can understand.

4. Train the GAN

python train.py --data_dir path/to/midi/files

You can also adjust the training parameters, such as the batch size and the number of epochs in the train.py file

5. Generate new music


This will generate new MIDI files in the `output` directory. You can then use a MIDI player to listen to the generated music.

## Results
The results of the GAN will depend on the quality and diversity of the training data as well as the training parameters. It may take some experimentation to find the optimal settings for generating music that sounds good to you.

Additionally, the GAN may generate music that is not always perfect and may contain errors or inconsistencies. It is a good idea to listen to the generated music and manually curate the outputs to achieve the desired results.

## Future Work
Incorporating additional data such as lyrics and chord progressions to generate more realistic and diverse music.
Experimenting with different GAN architectures such as WGAN or Progressive GAN to improve the quality of the generated music.
Incorporating other forms of music such as orchestral or electronic to expand the range of generated music.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of GANs in generating polyphonic music. While it is not perfect and requires further development, it is an exciting step towards creating new music using AI. We hope this project inspires others to experiment with GANs and music generation.
