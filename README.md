Fun side project to make polyphonic music with GANs
Polyphonic Music GAN
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning models that can be used to generate new data that is similar to a training set. This repository contains a GAN that is trained to generate polyphonic music, that is, music that contains multiple simultaneous melodies.

Requirements
Python 3.6+
TensorFlow 2.0+
MIDI files for training
Usage
Clone this repository
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/polyphonic-music-gan.git
Install the required packages
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Collect and prepare MIDI files for training. The GAN requires a dataset of MIDI files to train on. You can use any publicly available MIDI files or create your own. Once you have your dataset, preprocess the files by converting them to a format that the GAN can understand.

Train the GAN

Copy code
python train.py --data_dir path/to/midi/files
You can also adjust the training parameters, such as the batch size and the number of epochs in the train.py file

Generate new music
Copy code
python generate.py --checkpoint_dir path/to/checkpoints
This will generate new MIDI files in the output directory. You can then use a MIDI player to listen to the generated music.

Results
The generated music will be different depending on the training dataset and the parameters used during training. It is possible that the generated music will not sound good or be musically coherent. However, with enough training data and fine-tuning of the parameters, the GAN can be made to generate music that is similar to the training set and has good musical coherence.

Future Work
This is a basic implementation of a GAN for generating polyphonic music. In future work, we could explore other architectures, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or Transformer networks, that may be better suited for this task. Additionally, we could also incorporate other types of data, such as audio files, to improve the quality of the generated music.

Conclusion
This project provides a basic implementation of a GAN for generating polyphonic music. With enough training data and fine-tuning of the parameters, the GAN can be made to generate music that is similar to the training set and has good musical coherence. Further research is needed to improve the quality of the generated music and explore other architectures that may be better suited for this task.
